# AI-Powered-Interview-Assistant
AI Powered Interview Assistant
📘 Project Overview
The AI Interview Assistant is a smart web application designed to help candidates prepare for technical interviews more effectively. By combining resume parsing, intelligent question generation, and AI-powered feedback, the assistant creates a tailored mock interview experience.

When a user uploads their resume, the system parses key skills and qualifications using NLP techniques. Based on this information, it generates relevant interview questions using Hugging Face LLMs. Candidates can then respond to each question, and the assistant evaluates the answers by analyzing clarity, relevance, and tone—providing actionable feedback to help users refine their interview skills.

📄 Resume Parsing – Automatically extracts key information from uploaded resumes.

💬 Question Generation – Uses Hugging Face LLMs to craft tailored interview questions.
